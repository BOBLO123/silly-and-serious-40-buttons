## What Is This?    

This is a collection of two separate, but equally purple *“proxies”*  for the uninitiated. In reality, this is simply a small web page, that will take a submitted URL and add a load of percent-encoded characters[^1], specifically %40, which is the encoded version of @. Adding this before a URL, the newly opened link is difficult to parse for many extensions, and therefore is loaded as if there are none. This is tested working with DyKnow and Securely[^3], if you tested it on another blocking extension	and it works, please make an issue. This also comes with Hangify[^2], which after a while of processing, should hopefully hang a selected extension for a duration of time, therefore rendering it incapable of blocking websites etc. This is very much a work in progress and will require your support. Please star this repository and share it with your friends. The HTML data links are not up to date and will not be until the project is considered finished.

 [^1]: **(The method used to bypass extensions is using “percent-encoding", which is under public domain, and therefore not licensable by any party. We have faced threatened strikes over this, so do not listen to someone claiming to "own" %40, (Ex. Someone named "d" on discord))**
[^2]: I don't know who created hangify, if you do know and can provide evidence, please make an issue.
[^3]: Linewize is currently known not to work



### silly.html is the better version for sillies, hipposite.html is for when you need it to actually look serious.
Hipposite is created by hand. As one person develops it, it is far more coordinated and efficient, with more functional code that is also reusable. It is a good choice for those wishing to contribute.


Download the file of your choice *(silly.html  or hipposite.html)* and open it in your browser.
