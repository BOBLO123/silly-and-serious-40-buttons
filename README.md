## What Is This?    

This is a collection of two separate, but equally purple *“proxies”* for the uninitiated. In reality, this is simply a small web page, that will take a submitted URL and ad a load of percent-encoding characters[^1], specifically %40, which is the encoded version of @. Adding this before a URL, the newly opened link is difficult to parse for many extensions, and therefore is loaded as if there are none. This is tested working with DyKnow and Securely, if you tested it on another blocking extension	and it works, please make an issue. This also comes with ExtHang3r, which after a while of processing, should hopefully hang a selected extension for a duration of time, therefore rendering it incapable of blocking websites etc. This is very much a work in progress and will require your support. Please star this repository and share it with your friends.

(ALL CREDIT FOR FINDING THE 40% METHOD IS FROM US, (FUCK YOU @AZ.WT, YOUR LICENCE IS FALSE AND NON PROPER, BEING THAT ITS NOT LEGALY BINDING AND BEING THAT PERCENT-ENCODING IS PUBLIC DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE, YOU ARE UNABLE TO PUT ANY LICACNE ON IT) AND THIS CONTENT WAS MADE FOR THE SOLE PURPOUSE OF MAKING IT EASIER TO FUCK UP YOUR GRADES, AND MAKE YOU HAPPY)
